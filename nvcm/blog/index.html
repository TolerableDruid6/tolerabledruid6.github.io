<h2>Development blog: Updates and new info!</h2>

<h3>06/28/2020, 7:28 PM: Now that everything's out of the way...</h3>
<br>
pre6 has been released, with the final fixes, and guess what that's meaning - we're finally starting proper work on multiplayer!

Hopefully we should have an MP test today. There will be a server running, and we'll release an MP test client.

<h3>06/28/2020, 4:09 PM: 0.31-pre5 is live</h3>
<br>
This build along with pre6 are just small enhancement updates, cleaning the game up before we start doing the multiplayer test. Just a few small fixes and a new "can break bedrock in creative sp" gamerule.

<br>
Have fun!

<h3>06/26/2020: Welcome to the blog!</h3>
<br>
Welcome to the new NVCM website, and the new, shiny, epic NVCM blog!
<br>
This is the official home for future NVCM development updates, previews, and info. I don't really have much to say since this is pretty self explanatory, but watch out for upcoming posts! It's not just me who will be posting here too - this site is going to be accessable by other members of the NVCM team :)
<br>
P.S. 0.30-pre4 today?
<br>

edit: 0.31 not 0.30
